### APT Attribution  
**Definition:**  
The process of assigning (attributing) an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack to a specific individual, group, or state-sponsored actor. This involves analyzing malicious software, infrastructure, and TTPs to determine which APT group or threat actor is behind the operation.
  
**Example Usage:**  
Security analysts attributed the targeted phishing campaign to APTXX after identifying code similarities in the malicious emails, linking it to the group’s espionage operations.

## - B -

### Bitcoin  
**Definition:**  
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cryptocurrency that can be transferred peer-to-peer (P2P) without intermediaries. Transactions are verified through cryptography and recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain. In the cybercrime world, it is often used in ransomware attacks and illicit online trade.  

**Example Usage:**  
In a ransomware attack, the attackers demanded payment in Bitcoin in exchange for decrypting the victim's files.

## - C -

### Campaign Correlation  
**Definition:**  
The process of determining whether multiple cyber incidents or indicators of compromise (IoCs) are part of the same threat campaign by analyzing their shared characteristics and relationships. Analysts correlate malicious infrastructure, malware families, or similar tactics across incidents.  

**Example Usage:**  
The threat intelligence team performed campaign correlation and discovered that a series of phishing emails were all part of a single operation carried out by the same APT group.

### Crack  
**Definition:**  
The act of removing or bypassing copy protection or licensing mechanisms in software, or the small program/script that achieves this. Commonly refers to illegal tools or techniques used to circumvent software licensing restrictions. The term also applies to password cracking—the act of bypassing security mechanisms such as passwords. 
 
**Example Usage:**  
A hacker developed a crack to disable the license check of a popular antivirus program and shared it on piracy forums.

### Deep Web  
**Definition:**  
The portion of the Internet that is not indexed by standard search engines. Password-protected databases, intranets, and sites requiring registration are considered part of the deep web. (Dark web is a sub-section of the deep web, accessible only via special software and often associated with illicit activities.)  

**Example Usage:**  
Many illegal forums and marketplaces operate on the deep web, out of reach of search engines; cyber threat intelligence analysts often monitor these environments for data leaks.

---

## - E -

### Email Spoofing  
**Definition:**  
The act of altering the sender information in an email to make it appear as if it comes from a trusted source or individual. The goal is to deceive the recipient, often as part of phishing or fraud campaigns.  

**Example Usage:**  
An attacker used email spoofing to impersonate the company CEO and sent an urgent payment request to the accounting department, making it look as if it came from the CEO's address.

---

## - F -

### Flashpoint  
**Definition:**  
A cyber threat intelligence platform and company focused on monitoring the dark web and cybercriminal activity. Flashpoint collects data from illicit forums and marketplaces, providing customers with up-to-date threat reports and indicators, enabling organizations to track threats emerging from the deep/dark web. 
 
**Example Usage:**  
Intelligence analysts use Flashpoint to monitor dark web forums for mentions of their company and to detect the sale of stolen data, allowing proactive defense.

### Indicator Pivoting  
**Definition:**  
A method in threat intelligence where an IoC (indicator of compromise) is used as a starting point to discover related indicators and information. For example, starting with a malware hash, analysts can pivot to find other systems where the hash appears, related IPs, or domain names. 
 
**Example Usage:**  
An analyst performed indicator pivoting by searching for a malicious file hash in VirusTotal, discovering other files with the same hash and identifying related command and control server addresses.

### Kits-as-a-Service  
**Definition:**  
The concept of providing exploit kits or other attack toolkits as a service, typically through a subscription or rental model. This enables less-skilled attackers to purchase and use ready-made attack tools. For instance, an exploit kit may be rented for a specific period to launch attacks. 
 
**Example Usage:**  
A cybercriminal launched a ransomware campaign by renting a Ransomware-as-a-Service kit offered on the dark web, without needing advanced technical skills.

### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)  
**Definition:**  
Intelligence gathered by collecting and analyzing information from publicly available, legally accessible sources. This includes the Internet, social media, news sites, public databases, and other sources open to everyone. OSINT is used to produce actionable security insights.
  
**Example Usage:**  
A cyber security analyst used OSINT techniques to assess the scope of a threat against the company by examining hacker social media posts, forum messages, and domain registration data.

## - P -

### Pivoting  
**Definition:**  
A technique in which an attacker uses a compromised system as a pivot point to move laterally within the same network or to access connected systems. Pivoting is essential in advanced attacks, allowing intruders to reach more valuable assets.  

**Example Usage:**  
During a penetration test, the expert used pivoting from a compromised web server to access a database server on the internal network, gaining access to sensitive data.

---

## - R -

### Reverse Engineering  
**Definition:**  
The process of thoroughly analyzing a system, device, or software to understand its operation, components, and internal structure. In cybersecurity, reverse engineering is frequently used for malware analysis and vulnerability research (e.g., disassembling code to understand how a virus works).  

**Example Usage:**  
A malware analyst used reverse engineering techniques to decode the ransomware’s encryption algorithm and examined the malicious code with Ghidra to reveal how the attack functioned.

---

## - S -

### Shellcode  
**Definition:**  
A small piece of machine code used as a payload during software exploitation. Historically, shellcode was designed to open a shell on the target system, but modern shellcodes perform a wide range of malicious activities, such as establishing backdoors or exfiltrating data.  

**Example Usage:**  
The attacker injected custom shellcode into the target system by exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability. When executed, the shellcode created a reverse shell, granting the attacker command line access to the server.

## - T -

### Technical CTI  
**Definition:**  
Cyber threat intelligence that includes technical indicators and tactical/technical details relevant to defending networks and systems. Typically short-lived, these indicators include C2 server addresses, malware signatures, lists of malicious IPs/URLs, and phishing artifacts.  

**Example Usage:**  
The SOC team applied technical CTI feeds to firewall and IDS systems, blocking malicious IP addresses and proactively stopping intrusion attempts on the network.

### Victimology  
**Definition:**  
The analysis of the characteristics of victims targeted in a cyberattack and the attacker’s motivation. Victimology helps security teams distinguish between random phishing and highly targeted, sector-specific campaigns.  

**Example Usage:**  
Intelligence analysts noticed that all recent attacks targeted energy sector companies. This victimology analysis suggested that the threat actor’s motivation was likely to disrupt energy infrastructure, rather than simple financial gain.

### ZeroNet  
**Definition:**  
A decentralized web platform based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking, developed in 2015. ZeroNet sites operate without central servers; each site is identified by a Bitcoin address (public key), and content is distributed via BitTorrent trackers to all users. This architecture makes ZeroNet resistant to censorship and takedown attempts.  

**Example Usage:**  
Cybercriminals use ZeroNet to host malicious content or share stolen data without fear of takedown or censorship. For example, a site distributing stolen credentials could not be removed using traditional domain blocking or server takedown methods, as it was hosted on ZeroNet.
